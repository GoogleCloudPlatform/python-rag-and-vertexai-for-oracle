# Generative AI Database Samples

This repository contains samples for interacting with an Oracle database using generative AI. The samples are structured as an incremental guide, mirroring the code's development process.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

* **Git:** You need Git installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or install it via your operating system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install git` on Ubuntu, `brew install git` on macOS).
* **SSH Key (Recommended for GitHub):** For more secure and convenient access to GitHub, it's recommended to set up an SSH key. If you haven't done this before, GitHub provides excellent guides:
    * [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    * [Adding your SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

### Cloning the Repository

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate to the directory** where you want to save the project. For example:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Documents/GitHub
    ```
    (You can create this directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p ~/Documents/GitHub`)

3.  **Clone the repository** using one of the following methods:

    **Option A: Using SSH (Recommended)**
    If you have set up your SSH key with GitHub, this method is more secure and generally easier for repeated access.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:sam-gamare/genai-db-samples.git
    ```

    **Option B: Using HTTPS**
    If you haven't set up SSH keys, or prefer HTTPS, you can use this method. You might be prompted for your GitHub username and password (or a Personal Access Token if you have 2FA enabled).
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sam-gamare/genai-db-samples.git](https://github.com/sam-gamare/genai-db-samples.git)
    ```

4.  **Navigate into the cloned directory:**
    ```bash
    cd genai-db-samples
    ```

You now have a local copy of the repository and can proceed with the project's setup (e.g., installing dependencies, running the application).
